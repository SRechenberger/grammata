grammata 
========

**grammata** is a script language interpreted and run on a monadic virtual machine.
It supports polyparadigmatic features such as 
  * imperative procedures and functions 
  * functional expressions 
  * logical knowledge bases and queries to use them

This project, in particular, the virtual Machine, was part of the Bachelor Thesis
"Das Grammateion - Monadische Implementierung einer virtuellen Maschine zur Ausf√ºhrung einer polyparadigmatischen Programmiersprache"
("The Grammateion - Monadic Implementation of a virtual machine for the execution of a polyparadigmatic programming language")
by Sascha Rechenberger.
